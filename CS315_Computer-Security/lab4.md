## Lab4 Part 1

1. Read the lab instructions above and finish all the tasks.

   

2. Use nmap to scan the target and find the software version of the OS and the running services (list at least 3 of the running services). What are the differences if we use T1, T2, T3 flags? How to avoid detection from an intrusion detection system (e.g., stealthy scanning)?

   



## Lab4 Part 2

1. Read the lab instructions above and finish all the tasks.

   

2. Why do we need to assign an internal IP address(i.e.,behind NAT) for Metasploitable2-Linux? What will happen if we assign a public IP to it?

   

3. Besides the two vulnerabilities we used,exploitan other vulnerability using both msfconsole and Armitage. Show me that you have placed a file in the exploited remote machine via screenshots and by creating the file with the command “touch \<yourname\>” where \<yourname\> should be replaced with your full name.
